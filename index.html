              Basketball is my favorite sport. Basketball, game played between
              two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually
              indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the
              opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a
              basket. The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball
              was invented by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1,
              1891, at the International Young Men’s Christian Association
              (YMCA) Training School (now Springfield College), Springfield,
              Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical
              education.

              For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals
              two half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The
              students were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting,
              William R. Chase made a midcourt shot—the only score in that
              historic contest. Word spread about the newly invented game, and
              numerous associations wrote Naismith for a copy of the rules,
              which were published in the January 15, 1892, issue of the
              Triangle, the YMCA Training School’s campus paper.

              While basketball is competitively a winter sport, it is played on
              a 12-month basis—on summer playgrounds, in municipal, industrial,
              and church halls, in school yards and family driveways, and in
              summer camps—often on an informal basis between two or more
              contestants. Many grammar schools, youth groups, municipal
              recreation centres, churches, and other organizations conduct
              basketball programs for youngsters of less than high school age.
